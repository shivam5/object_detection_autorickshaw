Download the dependencies and outputs from google drive
link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oNXrOHV35RyoykAqJPNWTGW5yW5mXPKk)
Dependencies and outputs:
outputs
test_output.mat
auto_det_chal_train_7oct folder
matconvnet-1.0-beta25 folder
imagenet-googlenet-dag.mat
SVM_models.mat
train_features.mat

Running and compiling
-----------------------

The training and test results have already been attached because they take long time.
training yields 2 files -> train_features.mat and SVM_models.mat
If you want to train again, delete these 2 files and run Train_2015CSB1032.m:
1. Open matlab
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run Train_2015CSB1032.m

test results are stored as images in outputs folder and as bounding boxes in test_output.mat
If you want to test again, delete the images insider output/ (keep the folder) and delete test_output.mat
and run Test_2015CSB1032.m :
1. Open matlab
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run Test_2015CSB1032.m

The script Train_2015CSB1032.m read the 0.jpg to 599.jpg images from the auto_det_chal_train_7oct/images folder
and labels from auto_det_chal_train_7oct/bbs/bbs.json

The script Test_2015CSB1032.m reads the 600.jpg to 799.jpg from auto_det_chal_train_7oct/images for testing.
If you want to test on other images, changes will have to be made in the Test_2015CSB1032.m script.
The results of the detector are stored in the outputs folder as images, and in the test_output


File and folder information
----------------------------
auto_det_chal_train_7oct -> Contains data for training and testing

matconvnet-1.0-beta25 -> Code for running pre-trained neural networks [1]

outputs -> The images outputs for test images

extract_feature_2015CSB1032.m -> Script for extract features frmo images

imagenet-googlenet-dag.mat -> The pretrained CNN weights

JSON.m -> JSON file parser for MATLAB [2]

SVM_models.mat -> The SVM classifier saved so that retraining is not needed

Test_2015CSB1032.m -> Test script

test_output.mat -> The bounding boxes dimensions stored. The first bounding box is for image 600 and so on.

Train_2015CSB1032.m -> Train script

train_features.mat -> Features of patches extracted from bounding boxes used for training
